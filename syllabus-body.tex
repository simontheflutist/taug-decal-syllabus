\subsection{Course Description}
%\emph{To An Unknown God} is a journal of Christian thought at UC Berkeley.
%This class is designed to introduce students to the publishing process.
At the end of each semester, \emph{To an Unknown God}, a journal of Christian thought at UC Berkeley, publishes writing and artwork produced
by Cal students and alumni in order to exhibit the Christian intellectual tradition in an increasing secular cultural context, with the purpose of fostering dialog between students of all faiths and philosophies.
Students will criticize a broad catalog of Christian thinking from patristic sources to 21st-century developments and reflect on their interaction with selected topics, both classical (e.g.\ suffering and free) and contemporary (e.g.\ race). Students will engage these issues in writing, discourse, and discussion.
Furthermore, students will learn the fundamentals of the publishing process, viz.\ writing, editing, and design in a journal setting.
